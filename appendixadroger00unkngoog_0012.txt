viii INTRODUGTION.

how is it proved thet Wendover wrote the remninder‘!
For on nnswer to this question the render is referred
to the Prei‘aoe os this edition, where, in addition to the
arguments edduoed in his behnlf, may he added further
the mode of dividing the work, as it is reoognized in
the campum-'s prologue, as oleo the tacit aeknnw-
ledgment of Paris himself, in suffering to be inserted
on the margin of his new volume,¹ et the time when
Wendover terminnted his leboms, the note following,
‘ Huc usque scripsit cronice dominus angerus de Wen-
dovre: etc.

In prepariug the present volume, the Editor has been
curer-11 to preserve every important variation with which
an accurate collation of the text with Wets' edition of
Matthew Paris and the Vni-ianuas Lectiones oi* that editor
could fumish him. 'He hes also, in any doubtful case,
sought assistance from the MSS. to which allusion has
been before made. At the seme time that he has not
thought it necessary to preserve every trifling deviation
from the original, which, although highly importent in
many cases in editing the classica] writers os Rome and
Greece, ean yet be bnt os little real valne in an his-
tarium writing et a period when elegance of style was,
comparatively speaking, little cultivated. The varie-
tions to which allusion is here nunde are such as the
reading «demutor sor in perpetum, siout sor prout, in
fraqam κίονος for ”liquot in suqam, ete„ alternating very
much on the sido of either historinn. The additions,
however, are everywhere introduced, and any marked
difference of style preserved. The following introduc-
tory chupters of the Historia Minor are here nppended,
in order to eonvey to the render some iden of the mode

adopted by Paris in the composition of that highly
interesting Chroniele.
