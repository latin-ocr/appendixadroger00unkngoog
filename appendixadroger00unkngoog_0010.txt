since, with the exception ol* the Cecil MS. erroneonsly
stated by Wats as being deposited in the C.CAC.
Library, Cambridge, no other copy of the Historia
Minor is known to have existed. Thnt the Ceeil MS.
did contain the lesser chronicis is clear from the various
readings given by Wats at the end os the printed edi-
tions of Paris, all differing much from the present re-
ceived text, and agreeing verbatim with the Royal MS*
1nteresting, however, as this manuscript is on its own
amount, i< becomes even more valuahle from the light
which, as tho autom-aph of Paris, it throws upon the
question of the authenticity of Wendever's history.
From a compen-ison os it with the Cambridge manu-
script, the innovatious, whether by correction or nd.
dition, of Mntthew Paris may be asoertained with the
most minute accureey3 sor in the first volume os the
latter MS„ extending to the year 1189: the additions
sometimes on the margq'n, at others by insertion os new
leaves, at others again hy erasures written over, are all
by precisely the same hand. The volume spoken es
appears, in snut, to be the very copy os Wendover's
Chronicle, or the Great Chronieles os St. Alban's, used
hy Paris as the foundation of hie Historia Major,—
the ‘ copy’ aa it were from which his amended text was
to he transcribed. The second volume is by altogether
a different and a somewhat later hand. The text is
no longer Wendover's, but, as it would seem, the tran-
script of Paris' ‘first edition' os that ehronieler, and it
is remarkable that it is apparently in the same hand-
writiug with that os the Cotton MS. in the British
Musaeum. Still, the text os Wendover is not altogether
lest, and additions end erasures continue in the hand-
